            2. Equilateral triangle $ABC$ has side length $840$. Point $D$ lies on the same side of line $BC$ as $A$ such that $\overline{BD}

            8. An ant makes a sequence of moves on a cube where a move consists of walking from one vertex to an adjacent vertex along an edge of 
            the cube. Initially the ant is at a vertex of the bottom face of the cube and chooses one of the three adjacent vertices to move to 
            as its first move. For all moves after the first move, the ant does not return to its previous vertex, but chooses to move to one of 
            the other two adjacent vertices. All choices are selected at random so that each of the possible moves is equally likely. The probability 
            that after exactly $8$ moves that ant is at a vertex of the top face on the cube is $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime 
            positive integers. Find $m + n.$

            9. Find the number of ordered pairs $(m, n)$ such that $m$ and $n$ are positive integers in the set $\{1, 2, ..., 30\}$ and the greatest 
            common divisor of $2^m + 1$ and $2^n - 1$ is not $1$.

            10. Two spheres with radii $36$ and one sphere with radius $13$ are each externally tangent to the other two spheres and to two different planes 
            $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$. The intersection of planes $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ is the line $\ell$. The distance from line $\ell$ 
            to the point where the sphere with radius $13$ is tangent to plane $\mathcal{P}$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime 
            positive integers. Find $m + n$.

        <div class = 'problem'>
            11. A teacher was leading a class of four perfectly logical students. The teacher chose a set $S$ of four integers and gave a different number 
            in $S$ to each student. Then the teacher announced to the class that the numbers in $S$ were four consecutive two-digit positive integers, that 
            some number in $S$ was divisible by $6$, and a different number in $S$ was divisible by $7$. The teacher then asked if any of the students could 
            deduce what $S$ is, but in unison, all of the students replied no. <br>

            However, upon hearing that all four students replied no, each student was able to determine the elements of $S$. Find the sum of all possible 
            values of the greatest element of $S$.

            12. A convex quadrilateral has area $30$ and side lengths $5, 6, 9,$ and $7,$ in that order. Denote by $\theta$ the measure of the acute angle 
            formed by the diagonals of the quadrilateral. Then $\tan \theta$ can be written in the form $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively 
            prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.

            14. Let $\Delta ABC$ be an acute triangle with circumcenter $O$ and centroid $G$. Let $X$ be the intersection of the line tangent to the 
            circumcircle of $\Delta ABC$ at $A$ and the line perpendicular to $GO$ at $G$. Let $Y$ be the intersection of lines $XG$ and $BC$. Given that 
            the measures of $\angle ABC, \angle BCA,$ and $\angle XOY$ are in the ratio $13 : 2 : 17,$ the degree measure of $\angle BAC$ can be written as 
            $\frac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

                1 + f(n+1) & \text{ otherwise} 
                \end{cases}$$ and
                $$g(n) = \begin{cases}\sqrt{n} & \text{ if } \sqrt{n} \text{ is an integer}\\ 
                2 + g(n+2) & \text{ otherwise} 
                \end{cases}$$
            for positive integers $n$. Find the least positive integer $n$ such that $\tfrac{f(n)}{g(n)} = \tfrac{4}{7}$.
